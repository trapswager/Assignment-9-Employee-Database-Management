# Assignment-9-Employee-Database-Management

This Java application manages employee data using a database. It supports the following features:  

- Adding new employees (Create).  
- Viewing employee details by ID or listing all employees (Read).  
- Updating employee information (Update).  
- Deleting employee records (Delete).  

The application connects to a MySQL database named `employee_db` using JDBC. The `EmployeeData` class handles all database operations, while the `Employee` class represents employee details.  

The `main()` method demonstrates the functionality by performing each operation step by step.
