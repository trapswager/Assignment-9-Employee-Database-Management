# Assignment-9-Employee-Database-Management

This is a Java application to manage employee data using a database. It allows you to:

Add new employees (Create).
 •View employee details by ID or see all employees (Read).
 •Update employee information (Update).
 •Delete employee records (Delete).
The project uses JDBC to connect to a MySQL database named employee_db. The EmployeeData class handles all the database operations, and the Employee class represents the employee details.

To test the application, the main() method performs all these operations step by step.
